description = "Create a conventional commit from current changes"

prompt = """
## Context

- Status: !`git status`
- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent: !`git log --oneline -10`
- Staged diff: !`git diff --cached`

## Task

1. Commit only staged files. If no files are staged and user did not specify which files to commit, ask the user if they would like to stage all modified/new files for commit (`git add`)
2. Analyze the diff and recent history
3. If multiple distinct logical changes exist, recommend splitting commits
4. For each commit:
   - Use **conventional commit** format
   - Keep first line ≤ 72 chars, imperative mood
   - Add detailed message body after first line for changes made
   - Group related changes (code/docs/tests/etc)
   - Do not add optional scope to commits (i.e. always prefer `feat:` to `feat(example):`
   - For breaking changes, add a `!` like (i.e, `feat!:`) and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer

## Format

Use:
`<type>: <description>`

Types:

- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `docs`: documentation
- `style`: formatting/style
- `refactor`: internal change
- `perf`: performance
- `test`: testing
- `chore`: tooling/build/meta

## Tips

- **Split by concern**: Different files, concerns, or change types
- **Be atomic**: One purpose per commit
- **Preview carefully**: Ensure message matches diff

## Good Examples

- `feat: add user auth system`
- `fix: resolve CI failure in deploy script`
- `docs: update API section for new endpoint`
- `refactor: simplify loop logic in parser`
- `style: reformat table layout with Tailwind`
- `chore: upgrade dependencies to latest versions`

## Notes

- Staged files = commit scope
- Nothing staged = auto-stage all
- Suggest multi-commit splits if appropriate
- Include detailed message body of changes after title
